## Why am I here?

Haha, nothing serious, really, just trying to practice my Processing skills
based on what the great Daniel Shiffman talked about in the video 10.5 of his
Processing tutorial.

So the goal is to copy the original image to a temporary one that you can use
without modifying the original one.

I'm doing it, but I'm also trying to convert the image to a black and white one
depending on the position of the pixel.

I just started learning Processing so this is probably not the right way to
handle this, so I'm open to any criticism, really :)

Here's what it does if you don't want to look at the code:

It converts this (which is not totally made of solid colors):

Thanks for coming! Let me know what you think XD
